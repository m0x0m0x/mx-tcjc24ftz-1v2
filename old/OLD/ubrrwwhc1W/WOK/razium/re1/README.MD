## About Razium

```ml
Here is a 298 word description of a new extremely powerful alien ship that has suddenly appeared in the Milky Way galaxy and is slowly destroying and assimilating celestial bodies:

Without warning, a massive alien vessel dropped out of faster-than-light travel in the outer reaches of the Milky Way galaxy. Measuring over 100 kilometers in length, the obsidian-black ship was utterly alien in design, its sweeping curves and ominous spikes projecting an aura of menace. As the ship drifted through interstellar space, its advanced sensors analyzed the Milky Way before selecting its first target - a rocky exoplanet orbiting a dim red dwarf star.

The ship deployed glowing purple tractor beams, effortlessly tearing the planet apart and absorbing its mass and resources in a matter of hours. Moving on, it set its sights on a larger terrestrial world rich with life and oceans. But this planet's demise took longer, as the alien ship meticulously disassembled its cities, forests and creatures on a molecular level. When it was done harvesting everything of value, it fired searing energy beams into the molten core until nothing remained but scattered atoms.

One by one, worlds kept winking out across the galaxy as the alien juggernaut slowly grew larger and more powerful with each assimilation. Outlying star systems evacuated in terror, but there was nowhere to hide from its unstoppable advance. Desperate broadcasts pleading for aid went unanswered, as the ship's alien masters operated with cold, unknowable purpose. All attempts at communicating were ignored - it only sought the raw materials to continue its campaign of destruction.

As the ship drew closer to the core systems, rumors swirled that it possessed planet-shattering weapons capable of annihilating entire star clusters in moments. The greatest minds tried in vain to analyze its black shell, hoping to find some weakness. But it seemed nothing could hinder its inevitable approach, as if the galaxy itself was helpless against this hungry invading god from beyond the stars. Fear and panic spread as the extinction of all life appeared imminent.
